-------------------

I am a neuroscience PhD candidate studying in the [Epp Lab](https://epplab.com) in the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary.

## Academic Interests

![vasc_im](/images/deep_crop.png){: .align-right width="250"}

- My primary academic interest is studying the brain-wide dynamics supporting learning and memory

- My prefered techniques for these investigations include (but are not limited to - I'm always looking out for new techniques!):
  - Batteries of sophisticated behavioural analyses
  - Brain-wide mapping of immediate early gene expression and the graph theoretical analysis of these functional connectivity networks
  - _In vivo_ monitoring of cell type specific activity in specific target regions, at both a single cell level and at the level of regional population activity
  - Advanced histology and microscopy techniques, including various tissue clearing approaches, and sophisticated analysis of these images
  - 3D CAD modelling and the prototyping of scientific hardware
