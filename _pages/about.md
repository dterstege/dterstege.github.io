## Academic Interests

![vasc_im](/images/deep_crop.png){: .align-right width="250"}

My primary academic interest is studying the brain-wide dynamics supporting learning and memory

My prefered techniques for these investigations include (but are not limited to):
- Batteries of sophisticated behavioural analyses
- Brain-wide mapping of immediate early gene expression and the graph theoretical analysis of these functional connectivity networks
- _In vivo_ monitoring of cell type specific activity in specific target regions, at both a single cell level and at the level of regional population activity
- Opto- and chemo-genetic manipulations
- Advanced histology and microscopy techniques, including various tissue clearing approaches, and sophisticated analysis of these images
- The analysis of clinical neuroimaging data
- 3D CAD modelling and the prototyping of scientific hardware
