Open source tools and analyses are a cost-effective means of promoting reproducible science.  Here, I've included some links to analyses, build files, and electronics schematics for various open source tools which I've developped over the year.  With each of these, I've also linked the manuscript in which it was presented.

# FASTMAP

I am a developer of the [FASTMAP](https://github.com/dterstege/FASTMAP/) ImageJ plug-in for the registration of biological images to atlases. You can view the [eNeuro](https://eNeuro.org/) article for the package [here](https://www.eneuro.org/content/9/2/ENEURO.0325-21.2022).

# Fibre Photometry Analyses

I have developped several pipelines for the analysis of fibre photometry data obtained from [Doric Lenses](https://www.doriclenses.com) and [Neurophotometrics](https://neurophotometrics.com) photometry systems.

The most comprehensive overview of these anayles has been documented in a [STAR Protocols](https://star-protocols.cell.com) manuscript, which can be found [here]().

I've briefly outlined different applications below:
