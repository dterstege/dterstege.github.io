excerpt: 'Postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis has been demonstrated to affect learning and memory in numerous ways. Several studies have now demonstrated that increased neurogenesis can induce forgetting of memories acquired prior to the manipulation of neurogenesis and, as a result of this forgetting can also facilitate new learning. However, the mechanisms mediating neurogenesis-induced forgetting are not well understood. Here, we used a subregion-based analysis of the immediate early gene c-Fos as well as in vivo fiber photometry to determine changes in activity corresponding with neurogenesis induced forgetting. We found that increasing neurogenesis led to reduced CA1 activity during context memory retrieval. We also demonstrate here that perineuronal net expression in areas CA1 is bidirectionally altered by the levels or activity of postnatally generated neurons in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that neurogenesis may induce forgetting by disrupting perineuronal nets in CA1 which may otherwise protect memories from degradation.'
