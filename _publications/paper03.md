Memory storage and retrieval are shaped by past experiences. Prior learning and memory episodes have numerous impacts on brain structure from micro to macroscale. Previous experience with specific forms of learning increases the efficiency of future learning. It is less clear whether such practice effects on one type of memory might also have transferable effects to other forms of memory. Different forms of learning and memory rely on different brain-wide networks but there are many points of overlap in these networks. Enhanced structural or functional connectivity caused by one type of learning may be transferable to another type of learning due to overlap in underlying memory networks. Here, we investigated the impact of prior chronic spatial training on the task-specific functional connectivity related to subsequent contextual fear memory recall in mice. Our results show that mice exposed to prior spatial training exhibited decreased brain-wide activation compared to control mice during the retrieval of a context fear memory. With respect to functional connectivity, we observed changes in several network measures, notably an increase in global efficiency. Interestingly, we also observed an increase in network resilience based on simulated targeted node deletion. Overall, this study suggests that chronic learning has transferable effects on the functional connectivity networks of other types of learning and memory. The generalized enhancements in network efficiency and resilience suggest that learning itself may protect brain networks against deterioration.
