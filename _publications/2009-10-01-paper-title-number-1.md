excerpt: 'Understanding the relationships between sets of regions across the brain is critical to understanding of cognitive function. The application of graph theoretical analyses to brain-wide immediate early gene expression density provides a means of studying these relationships in freely behaving animal models. Here, we provide overviews of the steps required to apply these techniques and acknowledge critical considerations which should be kept in mind when designing and conducting these experiments.'
